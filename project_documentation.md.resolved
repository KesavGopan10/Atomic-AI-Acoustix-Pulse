## 🚀 Complete Product & Features

The product consists of a **Cross-Platform Mobile Application (Acoustix Pulse)** and a **High-Performance Backend (Medical AI Platform API)**.

### **Core Capabilities**

1.  **🫁 Respiratory Disease Classifier**
    -   **What it does:** Analyzes breath and cough recordings to detect respiratory conditions.
    -   **Conditions detected:** Asthma, Bronchiectasis, Bronchiolitis, COPD, Healthy, LRTI, Pneumonia, URTI.
    -   **Accuracy:** 91% weighted F1-score.

2.  **❤️ Heart Disease Risk Assessment**
    -   **What it does:** Evaluates 11 clinical data points (age, chest pain type, cholesterol, etc.) to assess cardiac risk.
    -   **Process:** Uses a 3-step LLM chain for triage, diagnosis, and full report generation on Amazon Bedrock.

3.  **🔬 Medical Image & Scan Analysis**
    -   **What it does:** Interprets various medical scans (Chest X-Rays, ECGs, CT scans, and MRIs) using Amazon Bedrock's Vision capabilities.
    -   **Benefit:** Provides instant radiological findings and structured reports.

4.  **🧪 Lab Report Interpretation**
    -   **What it does:** Uses Amazon Bedrock Vision AI to extract data from physical lab reports (blood tests, CBC, etc.) and interpret results based on normal ranges.

5.  **💬 Conversational Symptom Checker**
    -   **What it does:** A stateful, interactive AI assistant that chats with users to assess symptoms and provide guidance.

6.  **💊 Drug Interaction & Safety Checker**
    -   **What it does:** Checks multiple medications for potential pairwise interactions and contraindications using Amazon Bedrock models.

## ❓ Why It Matters

In the current healthcare landscape, many people face barriers to early diagnosis, including:
-   **Limited Access:** Shortage of specialists in remote or underserved areas.
-   **High Costs:** Expensive diagnostic tests and consultations.
-   **Anxiety & Confusion:** Difficulty interpreting complex medical documents like lab reports or scans.
-   **Delayed Triage:** Patients often wait too long before seeking care for critical conditions like heart disease.

**Acoustix Pulse** bridges this gap by providing professional-grade AI insights directly to the user's smartphone, enabling them to make informed decisions about their health.

## 🛠️ Architecture Stack

### **Frontend (Mobile App)**
-   **Framework:** React Native with Expo (SDK 52).
-   **Navigation:** Expo Router (file-based).
-   **Media handling:** Expo AV (audio) and Expo Image Picker.
-   **Language:** TypeScript for robust type safety.

### **Backend (Core Intelligence)**
-   **Framework:** FastAPI (Python).
-   **Model:** Random Forest (Scikit-learn) for audio classification.
-   **LLM Provider:** **Amazon Bedrock** (utilizing Claude 3.5 Sonnet for text and vision).
-   **Processing:** Librosa for sophisticated audio feature extraction.
-   **Environment:** Docker for containerized deployment.
